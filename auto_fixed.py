Here is the corrected version:
```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        return 1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

```
Explanation:

The original code attempts to divide 1 by 0, which is undefined and will raise a ZeroDivisionError. To avoid this error, we use a try-except block to catch the ZeroDivisionError and print an error message instead. This is a best practice because it prevents the program from crashing and provides useful feedback to the user.
