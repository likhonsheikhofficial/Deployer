Here's a corrected version of the function that avoids the error:
```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        return 1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."

```
This corrected function uses a try-except block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` exception that would be raised by attempting to divide by zero. Instead of raising an error, it returns a string indicating that an error occurred. This is a best practice because it allows the function to handle the error gracefully and provide useful feedback to the user.
