Here is one possible corrected version:
```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        result = 1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        result = None
    return result

```
This corrected version uses a try-except block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` exception that is raised when attempting to divide by zero. Instead of crashing with a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, the function prints an error message and returns `None`. This approach is more robust and user-friendly than the original version.
