Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        return 1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

```
This corrected version uses a `try`-`except` block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` exception that occurs when attempting to divide by zero. Instead of raising an error, it prints a message indicating that division by zero is not allowed. This follows best practices by handling exceptions gracefully and providing informative error messages.
