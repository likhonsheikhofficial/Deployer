Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        result = 1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        result = None
    return result
```
In this corrected version, we use a try-except block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` exception that occurs when attempting to divide by zero. Instead of raising an error, we print an error message and return `None`. This follows best practices by handling the exception gracefully and avoiding crashing the program.
