```python
def correct_function():
    try:
        return 1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

```
In the corrected version, I used a try-except block to catch the ZeroDivisionError exception that occurs when dividing by zero. This allows the function to continue running without crashing, and instead prints an error message when a division by zero occurs. This is a best practice as it helps make the code more robust and easier to debug.
