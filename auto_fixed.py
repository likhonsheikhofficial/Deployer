Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        result = 1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        result = None
    return result
```

In this corrected version, we use a try-except block to catch the ZeroDivisionError exception that is raised when attempting to divide by zero. Instead of returning the undefined result, we print an error message and return None. This helps to avoid crashing the program and provides a clear indication that an error has occurred.
